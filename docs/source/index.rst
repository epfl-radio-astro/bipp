===================
Image synthesis in radio astronomy is done with interferometry, a powerful technique allowing observation of the sky with antenna arrays with otherwise inaccessible angular resolutions and sensitivities. The Bluebild algorithm offers a novel approach to image synthesis, leveraging fPCA to decompose the sky image into distinct energy eigenimages. Bluebild Imaging++ is an HPC implementation of Bluebild.
